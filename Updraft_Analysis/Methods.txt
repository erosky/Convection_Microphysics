Big picture:

1 - Find flight passes through adiabatic updrafts.
2 - From the field data available, extract all the variables necessary to calculate moist static energy
3 - And other thermodynamics in the cloud.
4 - Study the microphysics happening in the cloud


Total water vapor and liquid water in parcel 
- Start with cloud regions with a below-cloud pass. Use that passes water vapor content as the total water.
- If these clouds are following moist-adiabatic trends, then cloud regions without a cloud base pass can be assumed moist-adiabatic
- and total water can be calculated from other variables.


saturation vapor pressure
- This can be calculated using the improved magnus equation and is a function of temperature only

saturation mixing ratio
- Is a function of pressure and saturation vapor pressure.
- Temperature has an error of ~1 K in cloud

If two clouds have the same moist static energy, then they are on the same moist-adiabat

if two clouds have same LWC, then they have both released same amount of latent heat.
rest of energy is distrubted across height above cloud base and temperature difference from cloud base
if h is same, that will all be the same.
if h1 < h2, then dT/dz of 1 is less than dT/dz of 2
thus a larger height z will be needed to condense the same amount of water dw/dz


We need a script to do initial data extraction
then a script to add a new variable that was overlooked
then a script to compute a new property and add it

IN CLOUD ONLY DATA SETS

- Are aersol concentration the same in updrafts below cloud base and in the other nearby regions below the cloud?
- If yes, we can take aerosol data from below cloud even if it's not in the updraft core.
- Is humidity in updrafts below cloud base the same as in the other nearby regions below the cloud?
- If yes, we can take humidity data from below cloud even if it's not in the updraft core.
