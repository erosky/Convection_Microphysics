RF04 -> 2 (in cloud updrafts only)(minimal GNI)
RF05 -> 1 (below cloud data is peculiar)(minimal GNI)
RF06 -> some regions, but its kind of messy, and not isolated cells, may not be worthwhile (no GNI)
RF07 -> 0
RF08 -> 5
RF09 -> 1 (very small shallow cloud, with small droplets as well)
RF10 -> 1 (no holodec data)
