# write script to calculate holodec lwc per timestep.
# for cloud pass, look at curve of cdp lwc and holodec lwc
# find shift in holodex time axis that will produce best CORRELATION between cdp lwc and holodec lwc
## first calculate the correlation
## then shift holodec time back to minimize
# record in a text file the appropriate time shift for the holodec
