Get CDP droplet distribution

2 seconds on either side of updraft
for a total of 4 seconds edge data

for the full cloud pass, find the droplet size distribution and calculate the cutoff size for top 10% of largest droplets.
How much LWC is contained in that top 10%

define drizzle size.


From CDP netcdf files,
- calculate the cutoff size for 10% largest drops
- plot concentration of large drops as a function of time and updraft velocity

plot cdp concentrations with horizontal line where 10% largest cutoff is

plot 10% cutoff size as a function of GNI

plot pcasp and cdp together.
start reconstruction of holodec segments.

----
identify below cloud segments for all regions?
got through each cloud pass
make a table to perform correlations
each row is a cloud pass
columns: avg LWC, max lwc, holodec 90% size, cdp 90% size, max updraft, avg updraft, 
cloud base temp, ccn conc, pcasp 90% size, gni largest size, moist static energy, height above CB,

for a constant lwc, the height above cloud base and moist static energy should be inversely related.
